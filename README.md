**This is a minimal aircraft simulation program.**

```
prompt: Frankfurt airport recently discovered that due to frequent weather changes,
        they have a bottleneck on some of the landing tracks. In order to find a solution, 
        they first need to know which scenarios create the worst bottlenecks. 
        So they decided to use a simulator where they configure and analyze multiple scenarios and 
        hope that this will highlight them were the real problem is.

* Singleton and Factory design patterns (for future extension)
* Java 7 

## To run: 
`
sh run.sh
`

## To see the simulator report
`
